# Fredo Diagnostic™
## Identifying Misassignment Under Enforcement-Driven Governance

**Method:** Myth & Mechanism™  
**Field:** Cultural Autopsy™  
**Use:** System diagnostic. Not an individual assessment.

## Purpose

Detect when a system with legible transfer and low variance tolerance is producing a designated liability role through misassignment and enforcement.

This diagnostic evaluates governance conditions, not personal traits.

## How to Use

Score each item 0–3 based on observed conditions.

0 = not present. 3 = structurally present.

Sum totals by section. Interpret using the risk bands.

---

## Section I — Transfer Legibility
*Whether authority has settled into a fixed office.*

1. Succession has occurred and is widely recognized.
2. Titles, reporting lines, and jurisdiction are explicit.
3. The line of authority is no longer contested.
4. Decision rights are attached to named offices.
5. Enforcement authority is formally granted.

**Section I Total (0–15):** ☐☐☐☐☐

Signal detected: closed transfer. Authority is legible.

---

## Section II — Variance Tolerance
*How the system responds to deviation.*

6. Deviation from expected role behavior is treated as threat.
7. Difference is interpreted as disloyalty or instability.
8. Role expectations are narrow and rigid.
9. Revision of role assignment is avoided.
10. Compliance is valued over adaptation.

**Section II Total (0–15):** ☐☐☐☐☐

Signal detected: low variance tolerance.

---

## Section III — Enforcement Posture
*How control is exercised after transfer.*

11. Sanction is favored over revision.
12. Enforcement is precise and attributable.
13. Shortfalls are framed as breaches.
14. Punishment is visible and instructive.
15. Accountability is concentrated rather than diffused.

**Section III Total (0–15):** ☐☐☐☐☐

Signal detected: enforcement-forward governance.

---

## Section IV — Misassignment Indicators
*Whether an office-holder has become a liability.*

16. Role demands exceed the individual’s fit.
17. Exposure increases through mandate, not performance.
18. Visibility converts mismatch into risk.
19. Correction targets the role-holder, not the role.
20. Removal is framed as necessity, not error.

**Section IV Total (0–15):** ☐☐☐☐☐

Signal detected: misassignment converted into liability.

---

## Interpretation & Risk Bands

Low Risk (0–20)  
Transfer incomplete or variance tolerated. Liability roles unlikely.

Moderate Risk (21–40)  
Transfer legible but enforcement uneven. Misassignment possible.

High Risk (41–60)  
Transfer complete, variance intolerant, enforcement active. Designated liability likely forming.

Critical Risk (61–80)  
Misassignment stabilized through sanction. System prepared to sacrifice role-holder to preserve regime.

---

## Critical Distinction

Destabilized heir (Kendall-type): produced by ambiguity. Authority unallocated. Failure diffused.

Fredo function (Fredo-type): produced by enforcement. Authority allocated. Mismatch punished.

Ambiguity disperses failure. Enforcement concentrates mismatch.

---

## Governance Law

Sanction substitutes for revision when variance is intolerable.

---

## FAIRM™ Alignment

High Fredo Diagnostic scores correlate with elevated risk on:

- Authority Allocation
- Variance Tolerance
- Enforcement Intensity
- Role Rigidity
- Exit Cost

---

## Scope Note

This diagnostic does not prescribe intervention. It surfaces structural liability production so systems can be evaluated without moralization.
