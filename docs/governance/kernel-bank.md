## Kernel Governance Rules

- Kernels are atomic. They may not be paraphrased.
- Kernels may be quoted verbatim only.
- Revisions create new kernel IDs. Old kernels remain archived.
- Kernels may be referenced by ID without reprinting text.

Treat kernels as product strings, not prose.

## Kernel Registry

| Kernel ID | Issue | Canon Kernel |
|---|---|---|
| MC-000-K00 | Meta | Canon diagnoses systems; it does not prescribe remedies. |
| MC-001-K01 | Issue 001 | Ambiguity is the architecture. |
| MC-001-K02 | Issue 001 | Succession is a constitutional event. |
| MC-001-K03 | Issue 001 | Decision rights are the protagonist. |
| MC-002-K01 | Issue 002 | Transfer changes the failure mode. |
| MC-002-K02 | Issue 002 | Enforcement converts authority from claim into condition. |
| MC-002-K03 | Issue 002 | The Fredo function is a system output, not a personality type. |
| MC-002-K04 | Issue 002 | Sanction substitutes for revision when variance is intolerable. |
