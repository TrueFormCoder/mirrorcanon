## Lexicon Governance Rule

Canon terms are structural operators, not descriptive language.

- Terms may not be redefined inside Issues.
- Any change to a term requires:
  1) a versioned Lexicon update, and  
  2) a new term ID.
- Issues must use terms exactly as defined here.
- Synonyms are prohibited.

## Canon Terms (Frozen)

### Constitution
The legibility layer that makes transfer recognizable and contest-terminating, regardless of moral content.

### Transfer
The formal allocation of authority that closes succession, hardens roles, and enables attribution.

### Enforcement
The sanction capacity that converts authority from a claim into a condition and converts belonging into compliance.

### Variance Tolerance
The allowable behavioral range before deviation is treated as threat rather than signal.

### Misassignment
Role allocation that creates exposure under enforcement conditions.

### Liability Role
A designated container for mismatch that preserves regime coherence through attribution and punishment.

### Decision Rights
The institutional powers to commit, veto, delay, and amend the record.

### Regime
The moving veto that controls time, information, and recognition across an institutional surface.
