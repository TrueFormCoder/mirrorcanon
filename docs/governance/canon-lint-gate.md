---

## Gate Rule

If any required check fails, the artifact is not Canon.  
Rewrite until it passes. Do not “massage” or hedge.

---

## A. Structural Integrity (Required)

- ☐ Diagnoses a system, not a person
- ☐ Names a mechanism and a consequence
- ☐ Avoids moral framing, advice, or prescription
- ☐ Remains true outside narrative context

---

## B. Paragraph Architecture (Required)

Each paragraph must satisfy all:

- ☐ One primary claim
- ☐ Reducible to claim → mechanism → consequence
- ☐ No backward-pointing pronouns without a named antecedent
- ☐ Quoteable in isolation without distortion

---

## C. Language Hygiene (Required)

- ☐ No em dashes
- ☐ No ellipses
- ☐ No exclamation points
- ☐ No rhetorical questions
- ☐ No scare quotes
- ☐ Colons used only after a complete clause (max one per sentence)
- ☐ Parentheses used only for enumerables (no nesting)

---

## D. Syntax Discipline (Required)

- ☐ Active institutional subject present (system, institution, regime, office, constitution, record)
- ☐ At least one operational verb present (governs, allocates, constrains, suppresses, converts, enforces, amends, vetoes, delays, ratifies, reverses)
- ☐ No hedging language
- ☐ No reader address (you, we, our)

---

## E. Evidence-Grade Grounding (Required)

- ☐ Includes at least one governance artifact or control surface per paragraph, such as:
  - minutes
  - memos
  - disclosures
  - press releases
  - agenda control
  - information throttling
  - recognition gating
  - selective enforcement
  - compensation levers
  - veto patterns
  - retention budgets
  - reorg frequency
- ☐ No anecdotes or illustrative fluff

---

## F. Archetype Discipline (Required)

- ☐ Archetypes framed as roles, not identities
- ☐ No collapse of Fredo / Defector / Golden Child
- ☐ No psychologizing language

---

## G. Canon Tests (Required)

- ☐ Hostile excerpt test: quoted alone, it still reads true
- ☐ Institution test: readable aloud in a board setting without apology
- ☐ Translation test: meaning survives translation without cadence
- ☐ Minute test: could be entered into formal minutes without rewrite

---

## H. Versioning and Governance (Required)

- ☐ Version number present in archive copy
- ☐ Publish date present in archive copy
- ☐ Any revision is versioned; no silent semantic rewrites

---

## Fail Rule

Any single failure blocks publication.
